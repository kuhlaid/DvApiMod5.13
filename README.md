# About this repository

This repository hosts a Python package for use with the Dataverse Project API. The package is installed via PIP but is not hosted on the PIP package service (https://pypi.org/). You can experiment with using this package as way to build your own packages for a Jupyter notebook.

## Using the package

I use this package with a Jupyter notebook (see [https://github.com/kuhlaid/dv-api-test/releases/tag/v0.0.3](https://github.com/kuhlaid/dv-api-test/blob/v0.0.3/v5.13/_installer_dataverseTest.py) for a working example of the install).  To see how it is implemented see https://github.com/kuhlaid/dv-api-test/blob/v0.0.3/v5.13/_worker_dataverseTest.py.
